notebooks with code from various science tutorials and books

ubc_ml is the tutorial from 2013 from the University of British Columbia given by Nando de Freitas

It contains the notes I took from his courses, the Latex formulas and code snippets in Python/ SKlearn to reproduce the results and show real examples
